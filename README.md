Certainly! Here's an example of a README file for your React assignment:

```
# React Assignment

This is a simple React web application that fetches data from an API and displays it in a list view. It also includes a user details page that shows specific user information based on the selected row.

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/AkshatGadhwal/React_Assignment.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
cd React_Assignment
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

## Features

- The application uses Redux Toolkit (RTK Query) for fetching data from the API.
- Each row in the list view is clickable and redirects to the user details page.
- On the user details page, the user's information is filtered by ID from the users array stored in the cache. This is achieved using `createSelector` memoization and `selectFromResult` from RTK Query.

## Directory Structure

Here's a brief overview of the directory structure of the project:

- `src`: Contains the main source code of the React application.
  - `components`: Contains components for Users-List page and User-Details page.
  - `features/users/api-key-slice.ts`: RTK Query setup.
  - `store`: Contains the Redux store configuration
  - `App.tsx`: The main entry point of the application.
